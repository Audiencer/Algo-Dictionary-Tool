# Algo Dictionary Tool
As preparing for a software development engineer, we need to remember as many algorithm as we can, such like Search and Merge, and it could be time wasting to search it on GeeksforGeeks everytime you forget it.

This tool is for managing algorithms locally under the src folder and call it in a API-like way.

## Usage
usage: main.py [-h] [-A {algorithms}] [-M {methods}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -A {tree,sort,merge,linkedlist,matrix}, --algo {tree,sort,merge,linkedlist,matrix}
                        specify an algo
  -M {merge-sort,quick-sort,merge-sort,reverse-column}, --method {merge-sort,quick-sort,merge-sort,reverse-column}
                        specify a method
